Flask-DBKit
===========

Simple dbkit integration for Flask.

NOTE: This extension is in a very early stage of
development and its use is not recommended, breaking
API changes are expected. The version number will be
pegged at 0.0.1 until some level of API stability is
achieved.


Overview
========

Flask-DBKit aims to provide painless integration of
`dbkit`_ for the `Flask`_ web framework.


Features
========

- Wraps each call to the flask wsgi applicaton
  with a dbkit execution context.
- Simplify database configuration values for
  different database engines.


Quickstart
==========

A simple example of how to initialise the extension::

    from dbkit import execute
    from flask import Flask
    from flask.ext.dbkit import DBKit
    import sqlite3

    app = Flask(__name__)
    app.config['DB_PATH'] = ':memory:'

    dbkit = DBKit(sqlite3)
    dbkit.init_app(app)

    @app.route('/')
    def index():
        return execute('SELECT "Hi there from your DB."')


Limitations
===========

- Currently limits the pool implementation to that as
  returned by `dbkit.create_pool`.
- Causes a pool connection on every application endpoint
  regardless of whether it actually uses it.
